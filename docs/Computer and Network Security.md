 The NIST Computer Security Handbook [NIST95] defines the term computer security as follows:
 
      The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives  of preserving 
      the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software,firmware, 
      information/data, and telecommunications).
      
### 3 main objectives of Computer Security ( also refered as CIA triad(Confidentiality,Integrity,Availablity) )

<ul>
  
  <li> <b>Confidentiality: </b>- To prevent unauthorized access on information, personal privacy and propriateary information. </li>
  <li> <b>Integrity: </b>- To provide consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorized people </li>
  <li> <b>Availability: </b>- To ensure that timely and reliable access to the information.This involves properly maintaining hardware and technical infrastructure and systems </li>
</ul>
